==========
Apache Empire-db is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of
the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet
to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Getting Started
===============

This component requires a Java 5 JDK (or higher).

In order to run an application with the Empire-Struts2-Extension please notice:

   This Extension works with the Sysdeo-DevLoader. You can download the Sysdeo-Tomcat-Plugin for Eclipse.
   In the archive you can find another zip-file named DevLoader.zip.
   You have to unzip this file to TOMCAT_HOME/server/classes or you should read the README.txt of the archive.
