In order to run an application with the Empire-Struts2-Extension please notice:

   This Extension works with the Sysdeo-DevLoader. You can download the Sysdeo-Tomcat-Plugin for Eclipse.
   In the archive you can find another zip-file named DevLoader.zip.
   You have to unzip this file to TOMCAT_HOME/server/classes or you should read the README.txt of the archive.
